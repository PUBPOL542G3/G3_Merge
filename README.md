# G3_Merge

This folder contains three files:
1) MergeCode.ipynb
2) Regions (1).xlsx
3) Triple_Merge.xlsx

The "MergeCode.ipynb" file is a Jupyter notebook file which contains code to merge multiple datasets together in the python coding language. This code creates the Triple_Merge.xlsx file using cleaned data located in other PUBPOL542G3 folders. The Regions (1).xlsx is another dataset that the MergeCode.ipynb file uses to create the Triple_Merge.xlsx file by merging global regions into the data frame.
